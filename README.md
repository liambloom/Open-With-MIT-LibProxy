# Open With MIT Library Proxy

A super simple extension (more json than js) that opens the current page page using the MIT 
library proxy. This means that if you have a study open that isn't publicly available, but
is available through the 
[MIT library collections](https://mit.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01MIT_INST:MIT&lang=en)
(and you have access to the MIT library collections) you are just one click away from having
full access to it.

### Licensing

This repository has no license. That is because it is so little code that it does not constitute
a creative work, and is therefore not protected by copyright. I would have no legal means of 
stopping you from using this code even if I wanted to.
